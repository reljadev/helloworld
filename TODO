    we'd need to somehow run this automatically
  how to persist data when instance restarts?

- securely connect to VM instnace using VPN maybe instead of SSH?

- why install docker with ansible instead of bake it into image?

- run server with dedicated least-privilege user?

- nginx's OIDC module (ngx_http_oidc_module) implements authentication as a Relying Party in OpenID Connect using the Authorization Code Flow. Unfortunately,

- why did we opt for oauth2-proxy? I did because it's much simpler to setup authentication as it already supports integration with IdP and doubles down as static website server, but is that explanation good enough?

- why PKCE?

cd /opt/keycloak/bin/
./kcadm.sh config credentials --server http://localhost:8080 --realm master --user admin
./kcadm.sh update realms/master -s sslRequired=NONE

- how many credits do I have in Azure? Would they cover a custom domain?
